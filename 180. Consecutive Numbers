# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT DISTINCT(A.NUM) AS CONSECUTIVENUMS FROM LOGS A
JOIN LOGS B
ON A.ID = B.ID+1
JOIN LOGS C
ON B.ID = C.ID+1 
WHERE A.NUM = B.NUM AND B.NUM = C.NUM;

#HERE WE SELECT THE NUM AFTER JOINING THE 3 TABLES (SAME TABLES) BASED ON THEIR IDs BUT EVERYTIME WE ADD THE ID+1 AND THEN COMPARE THEIR NUMS IF ALL ARE THE SAME
